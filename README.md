In the darkest night, in the brightest day, no ghost shall escape my sight

The argument of a night walker
The National Registration Bureau should have an API, in which it should be provided only to law enforcement agencies. Why, so say I don't have an ID on me or better, its lost or have forgotten
it somewhere, and am required to identify myself. What if I give them my ID number, names as they appear in the id, Then they query the given ID, If exists well am me, if not.?

Technology has grown. Since your biometric data(Fingerprints) was taken for you to be issued with an ID, well incase ID number fails, A query on BD might serve.

What if query on BD fails.?
Then you are presumed to be an illegal immigrant.

You are arrested. However its worth noting, there is not implicit law that you have broken for not carrying your ID

Api's and data proctection act?
Beware this simple example stores the data in plain text, for purposes of demonstration, The data generated is not affliated to any persons. Similarities to real persons or entities is merely
coincidental.
